Overview
====================

**Best attempt** to create small project on **Flight Booking**.



How to install
====================
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Before we install Django, create a virtual environment (also called a virtualenv)

```
python -m venv myvenv
```

The command above will create a directory called myvenv (or whatever name you chose) that contains our virtual environment (basically a bunch of directory and files).
Start your virtual environment by running:

```
$ myvenv\Scripts\activate
```
Now that you have your virtualenv started, you can install Django.
Before we do that, we should make sure we have the latest version of pip, the software that we use to install Django:

```
(myvenv) ~$ python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

How to use
====================

On Windows you should run the following command. 
```
(myvenv) C:\Path to Project>set FLASK_DEBUG=1
(myvenv) C:\Path to Project>set FLASK_APP=P2.py
(myvenv) C:\Path to Project>flask run

```
  


Running the tests
====================

To run the tests against the current environment:

    python test.py
